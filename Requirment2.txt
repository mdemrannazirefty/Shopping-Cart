1. Promo Code Integration

○ Add a new section in the Checkout interface to allow users to enter a promo code.

○ The available promo codes are:

■ "ostad10": Provides a 10% discount.

■ "ostad5": Provides a 5% discount.

○ Calculate and display the discounted total dynamically after the promo code is applied.

2. Promo Code Validation

○ Ensure the promo code is valid by checking against the provided codes (ostad10, ostad5).

○ If an invalid code is entered, display an appropriate error message to the user.

3. Discount Display

○ Clearly show the discount applied and the final total price in the Checkout section.

UI Updates

● Add an input field and a button in the Checkout section to allow users to enter a promo code.

● Display a success or error message based on whether the promo code is applied successfully.

● Update the cart summary to show:

○ Subtotal (before discount).

○ Discount amount.

○ Final total (after discount).

Error Handling

● Prevent multiple uses of the same promo code during the same checkout session.

● Ensure the discount amount is recalculated correctly if the cart total changes.
